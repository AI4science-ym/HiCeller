# HiCeller

## Model

The latest advancements in single-cell technology have brought unprecedented opportunities to uncover the molecular complexity of complex biological systems, particularly those associated with human-specific diseases. However, these advancements have also introduced new challengesâ€”how to efficiently annotate long-tail single-cell data related to disease conditions. To effectively address this challenge, we proposed Celler, a cutting-edge generative pre-training model specifically designed for single-cell data annotation.

## Dataset

### Celler-75

In our deep exploration of this field, we have not only gathered but also constructed a large-scale private dataset, Celler-75, which boasts an unparalleled data volume of 40 million annotated cells, covering 80 human tissues and 75 specific diseases. The scale, depth, and breadth of this dataset far surpass any publicly available dataset currently in existence.

</p>


We have currently released the test and training sets for [**seven tissues**](https://pan.quark.cn/s/dd520f55c876), including **lung, skin, kidney, brain, liver, cortex, and breast**, covering the four tissues and related experiments mentioned in the paper. In the future, we will update with more species and tissues. **Our dataset is strictly prohibited for any commercial use outside of academic purposes.** Violations will be pursued legally.
### MS & hPancreas

The  [**Multiple Sclerosis**](https://pan.quark.cn/s/471174cc07e3) (MS) dataset  and the  [**hPancreas**](https://pan.quark.cn/s/24a3c11553b0) dataset are publicly available resources specifically tailored for investigating particular human diseases.


## Reproduce

You can reproduce our project using the following methods:

```
cd HiCeller-main
```

Install the environment by running the command: 

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

After that, you need to modify the model path and dataset path in `test.py`. You can obtain our checkpoint model and data **here**. Finally, run `python test.py` to use **HiCell**.

```
python test.py --data_path /*******.h5ad --model_path /*******.pt
```

## Experiment

Our project introducing Gaussian Inflation Loss (GInf Loss) and a secondary training phase with hard sample mining, achieving higher accuracy in cell annotation compared to scBERT, scGPT, CellPLM, and other methods.
The Gaussian Loss GInf function can be found in the file located at `/hicell/loss.py`. This function is specifically designed to calculate the Gaussian-based loss, which is a critical component in optimizing the model's performance.

The model weights we used in our experiments correspond to different tissues, such as the  [**brain**](https://pan.quark.cn/s/33e4eccaed23) and [**kidney**](https://pan.quark.cn/s/0ba774da43c5). You can download the weights for the respective tissues by clicking on the corresponding link.
